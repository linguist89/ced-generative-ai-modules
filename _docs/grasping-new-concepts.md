# Grasping New Scientific Concepts

Generative AI has a strong potential for students that seek to enhance their learning process. In this module, we will explore how generative AI can assist you in grasping new scientific concepts, providing you with a valuable skill set for your academic endeavors.

## Use-case

When encountering a new concept in a course textbook, a research paper or elsewhere, it can sometimes be a challenge to comprehend it fully or understand the technical intricacies.

Generative AI can aid in breaking down complex ideas into digestible pieces, making it easier to grasp the concept. For instance, you can ask the AI to help you break it down, rephrase explanations and definitions, provide examples, and relate the concept to other familiar concepts.

An AI can serve as a tutor who does not tire from rephrasing explanations and does not lose patience.

Below, Bing Chat Enterprise (precise) was asked to explain _photosynthesis_.

**Prompt**: "Explain the concept of photosynthesis in simple terms."

> Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, algae, and certain bacteria to turn sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into food. Here's a simple explanation:
>
> 1.  **Sunlight**: This is the main source of energy for the process. The sunlight is absorbed by a green pigment called chlorophyll in the leaves of the plants.
> 2.  **Water**: Plants absorb water from the soil through their roots.
> 3.  **Carbon Dioxide**: Plants take in carbon dioxide from the air through tiny openings in their leaves, stems, and roots.
>
> These three ingredients are combined in the plant's cells to produce glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen. The glucose is used by the plant for energy and growth, while the oxygen is released back into the air. So, in a way, photosynthesis is nature's way of recycling carbon dioxide into oxygen that we, and other animals, breathe. It's a beautiful cycle! 😊.

**Prompt:** "Break down the key components of algorithmic complexity."

> Algorithmic complexity, also known as time complexity, is a concept in computer science that describes the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of computer resources used. Here are the key components:
>
> 1.  **Big O Notation (O)**: This is the most commonly used notation to represent the time complexity. It describes the upper bound of the time complexity in the worst-case scenario. For example, for a linear search algorithm, the Big O notation is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
>
> 2.  **Omega Notation (Ω)**: This notation represents the best-case scenario of the time complexity. For example, in a linear search algorithm, if the target element is the first one in the list, then the search operation takes constant time, represented as Ω(1).
>
> 3.  **Theta Notation (Θ)**: This notation represents the average-case scenario of the time complexity. It provides a tight bound on the growth rate of the runtime. For example, for a binary search algorithm, the average-case time complexity is Θ(log n).
>
> 4.  **Time Complexity Classes**: These are categories that algorithms fall into based on their time complexity. Common classes include:
>
>     - **Constant Time**: O(1), the time to complete the operation is constant and does not depend on the size of the input.
>     - **Logarithmic Time**: O(log n), the time complexity grows logarithmically with the size of the input.
>     - **Linear Time**: O(n), the time complexity grows linearly with the size of the input.
>     - **Quadratic Time**: O(n²), the time complexity grows quadratically with the size of the input.
>
> 5.  **Space Complexity**: This is another aspect of algorithmic complexity, which represents the amount of memory space that the algorithm needs to run to completion. It's often expressed in the same notations (O, Ω, Θ).
>
> Remember, a lower time complexity generally means a more efficient algorithm, but the best choice of algorithm can depend on the specific details of the problem and the specific requirements of the solution. For example, an algorithm with a higher time complexity might be more appropriate if it has a lower space complexity and memory usage is a concern.

**Follow-up prompt:** "Provide a real-world analogy for time complexity."

> Sure, let's consider the task of organizing a library.
>
> 1.  **Constant Time (O(1))**: This is like knowing exactly where a book is and going straight to it. No matter how big the library is, it always takes the same amount of time.
>
> 2.  **Logarithmic Time (O(log n))**: This is like using the library's catalog system to find a book. You first go to the right section (Science, Literature, etc.), then the right shelf (based on the author's name), and finally the right spot on the shelf (based on the book's title). Even if the library is large, you can find the book relatively quickly because each step reduces the number of books you have to look through.
>
> 3.  **Linear Time (O(n))**: This is like looking at every book in the library one by one until you find the one you want. The time it takes increases directly with the number of books in the library.
>
> 4.  **Quadratic Time (O(n²))**: This is like sorting all the books in the library by their publication date. For each book, you have to compare it with every other book, so the time it takes increases dramatically as the number of books increases.
>
> In this analogy, the library represents the input data, and the time it takes to find or sort the books represents the time complexity of the algorithm. Just like in computer science, different tasks require different amounts of time, and the most efficient method depends on the specific task and the size of the library (or the input data).

**Follow-up prompt:** I still have a hard time understanding it. Can you explain it to me as if I were a child?

> Sure, let's imagine you're playing a game of hide and seek.
>
> 1.  **Constant Time (O(1))**: This is like if your friend tells you exactly where they're hiding. No matter how many places there are to hide, you can find them immediately!
>
> 2.  **Logarithmic Time (O(log n))**: This is like playing a game of "hot or cold". Each time you move, your friend tells you if you're getting "hotter" (closer) or "colder" (further). With each step, you eliminate half of the possible hiding spots, so you can find your friend pretty quickly, even if there are a lot of places to hide.
>
> 3.  **Linear Time (O(n))**: This is like checking every possible hiding spot one by one. The more places there are to hide, the longer it takes to find your friend.
>
> 4.  **Quadratic Time (O(n²))**: This is like trying to find all pairs of friends who picked the same hiding spot. You have to compare every hiding spot with every other hiding spot, so it takes a lot longer if there are a lot of places to hide.
>
> In this analogy, the hiding spots are like the input data, and the time it takes to find your friend(s) is like the time complexity of the algorithm. Just like in hide and seek, different strategies take different amounts of time, and the best strategy depends on the specific game and the number of hiding spots (or the size of the input data).

## Walkthrough

### Step 1: Identify the Ccallenging Concept

Select a challenging concept from a course textbook or any academic material that you find difficult to grasp.

### Step 2: Create your prompt

Reflect on what makes it difficult to understand and create your prompt based on that. These can be starting points:

1. Rephrase or summarize an explanation.
1. Give analogies or real-world examples.
1. Simplify the explanation by asking it to explain it as if you were a 5-year old.
1. Provide examples of when, how and where it is used.
1. Relate it to other concepts that might be known to you.

**Remember**: you can always make follow-up prompts.
